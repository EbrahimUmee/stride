# Concepts

In Stride, users are required to claim their airdrop by participating in core network activities. An Airdrop recipient is given 20% of the airdrop amount up front, and then they have to perform the following activities to get the rest:

* 20% vesting over 6 months by staking
* 60% vesting over 6 months by liquid staking

At initial, module stores all airdrop users with amounts from genesis inside KVStore.

After 3 months from launch, all unclaimed airdrop tokens are sent to the community pool.
